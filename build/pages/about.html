				<p class="left widen">Our team consists of two engineers. We were first introduced to the crypto-currency market in passing Bitcoin has it's first huge bull run at the end of 2013. When Ethereum had it's first big run-up in March, that's when we started to get our feet wet and become more involved in the industry. As we dove in we realized there were little-to-no tools and resources available. Those that exist either lack features and functionality or have horrible user experiences. After being frustrated by the current state of the ecosystem, we knew we had to step in and start creating our own solutions. Not only for ourselves, but to share with the community. When not at our day jobs(*sigh*), we are dedicating as much time to developing easy-to-use and convenient tools and resources. Our vision for this project has greatly evolved since we initially conceiving it. We're excited for what's to come as well as the journey ahead and we're hoping you'll join us along the way!</p><br>
